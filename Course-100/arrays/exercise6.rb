# You run the following code...

# names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
# names['margaret'] = 'jody'
# ...and get the following error message:

# TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
#   from (irb):2:in `[]='
#   from (irb):2
#   from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

# What is the problem and how can it be fixed?

# Answer: A string was put into the array element assignment when it expects an integer
# To fix the problem you need to use an index instead of a value
